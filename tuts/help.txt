     What is Shell and Bash Scriptings?

    ref https://askubuntu.com/questions/172481/is-bash-scripting-the-same-as-shell-scripting

   - shell script= Bourne shell script ( default )

   - shell script is means all the scriptings bash, zash, cshecll, kash etc

   - bash script means specially for bash (Bourne  Again Shell )

   - bash, zash, cshell are advanced version of shell, and these can run shell script also

    
      name.sh    # shell script
      name.bash  # bash script

2)   running script
       ref https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22087378/difference-between-and-sh-in-unix
       ref https://askubuntu.com/questions/22910/what-is-the-difference-between-and-sh-to-run-a-script

       1) 
            sh file        # executing with shell interpreter in a new process
            bash file      # executing with bash interpreter in a new process
            bash file      # executing with bash interpreter in a new process

       2)
            . file        #  executes a shell-script file in the current shell process

       3)   
             ./file       # making executable & run
                            ( chmod a+x file )
                   
                         - it'll detect the interpreter based on hashbang line
                              ( 
                                 hashbang -> first line in script file 
                                 #!/usr/bin/bash
                                 #!/usr/bin/sh
                              )
                          - the script will be paassed to the interpreter in a new process

                            .i.e  
                              if the hashbang is #!/usr/bin/bash  then 
                                   /usr/bin/bash file
